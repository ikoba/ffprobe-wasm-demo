## Enable SharedArrayBuffer

SharedArrayBuffer is used in "ffprobe-wasm.js", so if you make your page, make it [cross-origin isolated](https://web.dev/i18n/en/cross-origin-isolation-guide/) by serving the page with these headers.

```
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
